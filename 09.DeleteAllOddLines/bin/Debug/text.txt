Welcome to the official web site of the free book "Fundamentals of Computer Programming with C#".
 It aims to provide novice programmers solid foundation of basic knowledge regardless of the 
programming language. This book covers the fundamentals of programming that have not changed
 significantly over the last 10 years. Educational content was developed by an authoritative
 author team led by Svetlin Nakov and covers topics such as variables conditional statements,
 loops and arrays, and more complex concepts such as data structures (lists, stacks, queues,
 trees, hash tables, etc.), and recursion recursive algorithms, object-oriented programming and
 high-quality code. From the book you will learn how to think as programmers and how to solve
 efficiently programming problems. You will master the fundamental principles of programming
 and basic data structures and algorithms, without which you can't become a software engineer.

A brave man saw a horse in his house while a duck was swimming in the lake.
 The brave man tried to catch the horse, but the house was too big and the horse too fast.
Finally the duck died because she was thinking about the horse and the man who was very brave.
If you wanna ride don't ride the brave horse.
